The solution involves replacing the loose comparison operator (`==`) with the strict comparison operator (`===`).  The strict comparison operator checks both the value and type, ensuring that both sides of the comparison are identical.

```php
<?php
$value = isset($_GET['value']) ? $_GET['value'] : 0;
if ($value === 0) {
    echo "Value is zero (integer)";
} elseif ($value === '0') {
    echo "Value is zero (string)";
} else {
    echo "Value is not zero";
}
?>
```

This corrected code explicitly checks for both an integer 0 and a string '0', providing the expected and accurate results regardless of input type.
